Good Day sir,
	I would like to note that instead of adding another "home" hyperlink I choose to use the logo as a means to go back to the index as I feel that it is a cleaner look
Another thing is that the location I used was a coffee business that a friend owns, in order to add the interactive map I needed a fixed location and I felt like this would fit well
